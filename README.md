## Getting Started
Install packages
  - `npm install`
  - `npm install -g typescript@2.0.3`
  - `npm install -g typings`
  - `typings install`

> grunt default-watch

** This will monitor local files in the `src` folder and generate them to the `build` directory **

## Marketing Cloud to Heroku

Marketing Cloud push to Heroku is done in two steps:
 * exporting DataExtention to zip file
 * loading this file to Heroku and uploading it to the PostgreSQL.

### Marketing Cloud setup
Make sure your Marketing Cloud account is provisioned with Mail, Automation Studio and Enhanced FTP.

Navigate to Email app and pick `Interactions` -> `Data Extract` in the top menu.

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/email.png)

Create three Data Exports.  To get started click `Create`.

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/mc_DataExtract.png)

Fill the form and click `Save`.  Repeat twice more.

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/de_zip.png)

The output is three data exports: `Demo_Customers_Convert`, `Demo_Customers_Export`, `Demo_Customers_Zip`.

Navigate to `File Transfers` and click `Create`

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/fileTransfer.png)

Fill the form and click `Save`.

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/fileTransfer_new.png)

Navigate to Automation Studio

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/automationStudio.png)

Create a new Scheduled Automation

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/automationStudio_new.png)

Switch to `Workflow` tab and select `Activities` from the toolbox on the right and drop them into the working area.

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/automationStudio_workflow.png)

For each step click `Choose` and pick activity created earlier.
* Step 1 - `Demo_Customers_Convert`,
* Step 2 - `Demo_Customers_Export`,
* Step 3 - `Demo_Customers_FileTransfer`,
* Step 4 - `Demo_Customers_Zip`.

Save and click `Run Once` to verify that Automation is working.  File will be moved to an ftp location.

### Heroku App setup

Once the file is posted to FTP it can be loaded and copied to PostgreSQL.

Typically Export/Import jobs are run as [one off dynos](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/one-off-dynos) via [scheduled jobs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler).

* Ensure pg connection string is set in `/src/script/load_data.ts`
* Ensure sftp credentials are set in `/src/lib/fileManager.ts`
* Variables in `src/script/load_data.ts`:
  * `pgConnectionString` - to store PG connection string
  * `sourceFileName` - to store file name in sftp folder
  * `sourceFilePath` - to store file path on sftp
* changes to `src/script/load_data.sh`
  * `_TableName` - schema.table_name value where to load data
  * `_TableFields` - comma separated list of fields which should match columns in the csv file.

* run `grunt default-watch` to compile TypeScript

### Running Job

* Once the app is compiled, execute `node /build/script/load_data.js` to run it.


## Heroku to Marketing Cloud

Heroku push to Marketing Cloud is done in two steps:
 * exporting PG table to zip file and uploading it to Marketing Cloud
 * starting Automation Studio trigger and loading data to DataExtention

### Heroku App setup

* Ensure pg connection string is set in `/src/script/export_data.ts`
* Ensure sftp credentials are set in `/src/lib/fileManager.ts`
* variables in `src/script/export_data.ts`:
  * `pgConnectionString` - to store PG connection string
  * `sourceFileName` - to store file name that will be uploaded to ftp folder
  * `destinationFileZipPath` - to store file path on ftp

* changes to `src/script/export_data.sh`
  * `_SQL` - sql query that generates data for export

* run `grunt default-watch` to compile TypeScript


### Marketing Cloud setup

Make sure your Marketing Cloud account is provisioned with Mail, Automation Studio and Enhanced FTP.

Navigate to Email app.

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/email.png)

Navigate to Admin and then click on Data Management on the right side -> File Locations.  We will create/find location from where Marketing Cloud will load exported file from Heroku.

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/admin.png)

Find/Create location where `Location Type` is Enhanced FTP Site Import Directory

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/Enhanced_FTP_Site_Import_Directory.png)

In top menu pick Interactions -> File Transfer and then click on Create

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/fileTransfer.png)

Fill the form.

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/Demo_Download_export_data.png)

Navigate to Interactions->Import and then click Create

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/Interactions_Import.png)

Fill the form

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/Demo_export_data_import.png)

Navigate to Automation Studio

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/automationStudio.png)

Create a new Triggered Automation

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/automationStudio_new.png)

In the newly loaded window switch to Workflow tab and click on `Trigger Setup`

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/trigger_setup.png)

Then select Activities from the toolbox on the right and drop them into the working area.

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/automationStudio_workflow_import.png)

For each step slick on 'Choose' and pick activity created earlier.
* Step1 - `Demo_Download_export_data.zip`,
* Step2 - `Demo_export_data_import`,

Save and make sure it's active.

![screenshot](docs/mcImgs/active.png)


### Running Job

* now your Automation is set and you can send the file from Heroku to Marketing Cloud.  Execute `node /build/script/export_data.js` to run it.


## Troubleshooting

#### Typescript error 1

If you run into the following error:

```
	typings/globals/require/index.d.ts(367,13): error TS2403: Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type.  Variable 'require' must be of type 'NodeRequire', but here has type 'Require'.

	>> 1 non-emit-preventing type warning
	>> Error: tsc return code: 2
	Warning: Task "ts:app" failed. Use --force to continue.

	Aborted due to warnings.
```

###### Resolution

The issue is due to the module at "globals/require/index.d.ts"
It appears that it is using Require instead of 'require'.

To fix this, remove the following line, from `typings/index.d.s`

	/// <reference path="globals/require/index.d.ts" />

#### Cannot read property 'setUp' of null

If you run into the following error:

```
	not ok 1 - TypeError: Cannot read property 'setUp' of null
	  ---
	  at:
	    line: 285
	    column: 14

	  test: TAP
	  message: 'TypeError: Cannot read property ''setUp'' of null'
	  source: |
	    if (group.setUp) {
```
###### Resolution

The issue is due to a missing null check in the nodeunit core.js file.

The issue is likely because a property was assigned null on the exports of the unit test somehow.

You can likely only find out which one it is by adding the following line at:
/usr/local/lib/node_modules/nodeunit/lib/core.js before of the line 285

	//Added line
	if(!group) return;
